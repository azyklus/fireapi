# Contributing to Fire

So you want to contribute to the project? There is one way to start, and that is by forking the project!
Once you have forked the project, you can add what you want to the project. Anything you feel will improve
upon the existing work is appreciated, and if you wish to see your own features in the upstream, do not
hesitate to add them!

Once you have added some of your own code—if you wish to see your additions in the upstream—you must open
a pull request. This process is made straightforward by GitHub: you may simply click the button to open a PR!

This pull request should be titled in one of the following formats:

- For a feature addition: `[FEATURE] <a succinct name for your feature>`
- For a bugfix: `[BUGFIX] <a short description of what was fixed>`
- For a QoL change: `[QOL] <...>`
- For a Core API change: `[CORE] <...>`

The body of the pull request should include at least semi-detailed information about what you are adding,
changing, or otherwise modifying about the library.

Assuming all is well, your PR will be accepted and merged into `trunk` and then `beta`/`latest` if your change makes
it to release.
